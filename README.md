# Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of shell scripts designed for various tasks. Below is a brief description of each script and their intended functionality.

## Scripts

- **fzfsh**: Utilizes `fzf` to select fonts for use with `figlet`. This script provides a user-friendly interface for font selection, enhancing the experience of generating ASCII art.

- **home_dir_cleaner**: **Note**: This script is currently under development and is not functioning as intended. Please refrain from using it at this time. I am actively working on improvements.

- **Other Scripts**: The remaining scripts in this repository are functional and can be utilized as needed.

## System Compatibility

These scripts have been tested on **Arch Linux**. Please be aware that package management utilizes `pacman` in this environment. Ensure that all dependencies are checked and installed appropriately. The `check_dependencies.sh` script is included for this purpose.


## Conclusion

Feel free to explore the scripts in this repository. For any issues or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
